# Maps


## [The Realm of Lord British](maps/britannia.png)

The world of the Ultima RPGs in the style of a pen and ink fantasy novel map.  Initial symbol placement used a hierarchical Poisson disc stippling algorithm on Wang tiles based on [Recursive Wang Tiles for Real-Time Blue Noise](http://johanneskopf.de/publications/blue_noise/).  I also created a custom rune font to maintain visual consistency with the drawn symbols.  Rough feature outlines were done in QGIS then densified with fractal subdivision.

## [Canada](maps/canada.png)

Black and white map of Canada.  Initially this was intended to be in the style of a fantasy novel map, but grew more modern over time.  Tree and mountain placement was done using Lloyd's algorithm.

## [BƒÅkoi](maps/baakoi.jpeg)

An experiment with SVG filter effects, random name generation, and a less visually dense way of representing forests using Inkscape's Path Effects.

## [The Lands of the Inner Sea](maps/inner-sea.png)

A commissioned illustration for The Assassins: Forged in Blood, by self published fantasy author Goran Zidar.

## [Earth on a Lampshade](maps/lamp.png)

A replacement for a damaged lampshade.  I worked backward from the shape of the lampshade to an equidistant conic map projection that would fit it using GeoGebra.

## [A Planisphere of Her Majesty's Martian Colony](maps/mars.jpeg)
A steampunk map of Mars using path and filter effects in Inkscape and feature tracing in QGIS.

## [Portolan](maps/portolan.png)
A fantasy map in the style of a portolan chart with generated names and SVG filter effect generated textures.

## [The Great Cities of Keystone and Abarack and their environs on Welstar the World of Order](maps/welstar.jpeg)
A map of one of the worlds in the online game RetroMUD done in Inkscape
